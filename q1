Consider the following Java class.

public class Wizard{

  Spell[] spells;
  Potion[] potions;
  String name;
  int points=0;
  
  public Wizard(String name){
    this.name = name;}
    
}

A.  Write a method for the Wizard class named "powerUp" that adds 10 to the field "points".

public class powerup{
public static void main(String[] args){
  int points = new intpoints(10)
  }}

B.  Write a method "cast" that casts the n-th element of the "spells" array.  
    Include an interface (seperately) for the Spell class to insure your "cast" method will interact with the class.
    
  public class cast{
  public static void main(String[] args){
    for (int i = 0; i<array.length; i++){
    int value = spell[i];
    System.out.println(value);
    }}}
    
C.  Write a "hello" method that prints an introduction stating the name of the Wizard.
D.  Write a main method for the Wizard class.  In it construct a wizard with name "Harry Poppins".  Use the hello() method.
