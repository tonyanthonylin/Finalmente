A.  Explain what recursion is and when it is useful.
    Explain what the |termination step| and |recursion step| are in a recursive method.
    
 recursion is the technique that you use to have a mathod itself to solve a problem. recursion can cut sown your code with your solutions.
 termination step is an end step where your program in stead of keep running in a loop, it terminates. recursion step is where it starts recursion.

B.  Describe the difference between a Queue and a Stack.

a queue is like a horizontal line which is first in first out, a stack is a vertical line and it's first in last out.

C.  Write a class for an element doublely-linked list.

 public DoublyLinkedList(){
  private DLnk next;
  private DLnk prev;
  public DLnk(DLnk next, DLnk prev){
  this.next = next;
  this.prev=prev;
}}

D.  Explain what a Merkle Tree is.  
    Describe the structure and purpose of a Merkle Tree.
    What is the Merkle root?
    What is the function of a certificate in this data structure?
    
    merkle tree is the kind of tree diagram where non-leaf node is a hash of the two nodes below it.
    merkle trees can quickly comparing datas and find it's parent or it's sub tree.
    merkle root is the bottom level of the tree, and it is each individual's work's hash.
