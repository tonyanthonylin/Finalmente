A.  Explain how digital signature works with public/private keypairs.

for example, we have a teacher and a student, each with a different digital signitue, with teacher's digital signiture, we can view the
information in both public and private, while the student signiture can only access public.

B.  Identify your favorite Java project this semester.  
    Describe two things you learned by doing the project.
    Describe two ways in which the project could be improved or expanded.
    
    my favorite java projext this semaster is blackjack.
    i learnt the shuffle method which i can re-organize an array of list. and i learnt how to better use latex when i'm writing the project
    by using many new data packs.
    the first thing that i couuld have done better is adding some more code into the blackjack code because a lot of the code is from what
    we did in class, and i could definelly write more discription for the method while wiring the paper for blackjack.
    
C.  Describe two advantages of object-oriented programming.
    Describe two disadvantages of object-oriented programming.
    
    OOP can be written in many different parts i stead of a huge chunk of code all together. OOP can be edited easily since you can just
    edit one segment of the code and others remains the same.
    OOB can be much larger than other programs. OOB works a bit slower than other programing method.
    
D.  Consider the following PYTHON code for the MNode class given below.
    What is the difference in the way Python and Java handle the declaration of datatypes?
    Explain the difference in how constructors are written in Python vs Java.
    Which language do you prefer?  Explain why.
    
    in python, you don't declear a type, but in java everything need to be deleared specificaly.
    you don't need to have a curly bracket in a constructor in python, and it needs to be indented in python.
    I perfer java because in java we don't need to make things indented and i can set veriables more specific.
