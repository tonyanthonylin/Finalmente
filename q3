    Describe two ways in which the project could be improved or expanded.
    
    my favorite java projext this semaster is blackjack.
    i learnt the shuffle method which i can re-organize an array of list. and i learnt how to better use latex when i'm writing the project
    by using many new data packs.
    the first thing that i couuld have done better is adding some more code into the blackjack code because a lot of the code is from what
    we did in class, and i could definelly write more discription for the method while wiring the paper for blackjack.
    
C.  Describe two advantages of object-oriented programming.
    Describe two disadvantages of object-oriented programming.
    
D.  Consider the following PYTHON code for the MNode class given below.
    What is the difference in the way Python and Java handle the declaration of datatypes?
    Explain the difference in how constructors are written in Python vs Java.
    Which language do you prefer?  Explain why.
